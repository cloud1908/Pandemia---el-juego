Details: Behaviors sprites for laughing statues and zombies.  Make sure to have the Stepping and Direction Fix options checked when using them!

Also have some skeletal horse SV battlers inspired by Avery's horse!  Sandwich a human battler between the base and overlay pieces of the skeletal horse to make a mounted battler.

For a detailed explanation on how to put a character on the horse, please check out Avery's post: https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/avys-mv-stuff.53317/page-53#post-889472
