The goal of this asset collection is to expand the RPGM MV character generation while keeping the style as consistent as possible. 
Focus will be on female assets for now, but they can potentially be used for males as well.

All of these assets are free to use both non-commercially and commercially in your projects. 
You may not redistribute or sell any of my assets by themselves. 
No credit is required, but you can link back to where you found them if you wish.

You can direct questions, requests and feedback to: monorus8@gmail.com

How to install
===============

Simply merge the Generator folder into your RPGM MV installation directory. 
The assets are numbered starting from the last RTP asset so if you already added other assets you might need to rename them to prevent conflicts.
Note some of my assets are designed to replace RTP assets. I would recommend overwriting all files if you update from a previous version of my expansion.
